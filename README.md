# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
# Project: NUMBER GUESSING GAME
# OBJECTIVE :
The objective of the number guessing game program in C++ is to create an interactive game where the player attempts to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range.
# KEY ACTIVITIES :
# Initialization and Setup:
The program initializes by seeding the random number generator (srand(time(0));) to ensure that the generated random number varies each time the program runs.
It selects a random number (secretNumber) between 1 and 100 using rand() % 100 + 1;.
# User Interaction Loop:
The program enters a while loop that continues until the user correctly guesses the secretNumber.
# End of Game:
Once the user guesses the correct number, the while loop terminates.
Display a message congratulating the user on their success and indicating how many attempts it took to guess the number. TASK1/assets/172867430/02e4194f-971b-47fa-813b-105e76c31379)
